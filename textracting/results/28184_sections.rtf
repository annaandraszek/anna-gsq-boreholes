{\b1SUMMARY\b0A program of exploration was undertaken to investigate the potential for Mt Isa styled copper mineralisation and Sedex styled mineralisation in the Dajarra area. An airborne EM survey was completed over the entire joint venture area and identified a number of significant conductors within prospective Mt Isa Group sediments and Eastern Creek Volcanics adjacent to the Wonomo and Mount Annable Faults. Several conductors were selected for ground EM surveying and geochemical soil sampling. Assessment of the results has commenced. EPMs 7650, 7649 & 10128 	1 	September 1996 
\b11. 	INTRODUCTION\b0BHP Minerals Ltd has entered into a joint venture with Aberfoyle Resources Ltd covering EPMs 7650, 7649 and 10128 to explore for Mt Isa-styled Cu and Sedex Pb/Zn styled mineralisation. The tenements are located between 30 to 110km south of Mount Isa and are accessible via the Diamantina Development road (Figure 1). This report documents the exploration activities undertaken by BHP Minerals Ltd since the inception of the joint venture on 3 July 1995. This work consists of an airborne EM survey; processing and interpretation of EM data; ground inspection of selected anomalies; moving loop EM surveying and geochemical soil sampling on selected grids. 
\b12. 	TENEMENT INFORMATION\b0EPMs 7650 and 7649 were granted to Aberfoyle Resources Ltd on 13 February 1991 and 15 February 1991 respectively. EPM 10128 was granted to Aberfoyle Resources Ltd on 24 June 1994. 
\b13. 	PREVIOUS EXPLORATION\b0Past exploration activities undertaken within the area of the tenement have been summarised in Appendix A. Prior to the inception of the joint venture, Aberfoyle Resources Ltd completed the following work: - 	a compilation of all previous geochemical data - 	Flying of 75Hz 1ms GEOTEM airborne EM survey - ground based EM follow-up of two anomalies identified from the GEOTEM survey - 	ground based EM follow-up of a 3750nT magnetic anomaly - drilling of a ground EM defined GEOTEM anomaly - 	two east-west reconnaissance gravity traverses Drilling by Aberfoyle Resources Ltd failed to intersect any significant mineralisation. 
\b14. 	EXPLORATION RATIONALE\b04.1 	Regional Geology EPMs 7650, 7649 and 10128 are underlain by a sequence of Early to Middle Proterozoic sediments and volcanics referred to as the Leichhardt River Fault Trough bounded to the west by the Palaeozoic Georgina Basin and to the east by the Kalkadoon-Leichhardt Block. The Kalkadoon-Leichhardt Block is in faulted contact with the Leichhardt River Fault Trough around Mt Isa and to the north but in the Dajarra area their relationship is not clear. The Georgina Basin is clearly on-lapping the Leichhardt River Fault Trough in the Dajarra area. 138930 	139900' 	139%30' 	140900 MT ISA MT ISA TEMPLETON 	1:100,000 SHEET 	MARY KATHLEEN 2100 GOA CREEK 	OBAN 	DUCHESS 10873 ANNABLE Duchess 7650 DAJARRA JV (2) 21%30 CARANDOTTA 	ARDMORE 	DAJARRA 10128 DAJARRA JV (3) Dajarra DA.JARRA GEOTEM SURVEY 7649 DAJARRA JV (1) 22900 LAKE KATHERINE 	LESLIE PEAK 	BUCKINGHAM DOWNS Scale 1 : 1,000,000 0 	10 	20 	30 	40 	50 km Cairns 	Lambert Conformal Conic Projection Standard Parallels 20%40' and 23%20 Townsville o Mt Isa 	Mackay Rockhampton $ 8 4 1 	BRISBANE LOCATION MAP BHP Minerals Ply.

In this area the Leichhardt River Fault Trough is divided into eastern, central and western zones. This report is only concerned with the central and eastern belts separated by the Wonomo Fault which extends into the Mount Annable Fault to the North. The basement consists of the Sulieman Gneiss west of the Wonomo Fault and the younger Bottle Tree Formation to the east. The Bottle Tree Formation is conformably overlain by the Haslingden group, while the Sulieman Gneiss is overlain by the Kallala Quartzite and the Jayah Creek Metabasalt including the Timothy Creek Sandstone Member. The Jayah Creek Metabasalt is possibly equivalent to the Eastern Creek Volcanics which forms the lower part of the Haslingden Group with the Mount Guide Quartzite. The Haslingden Group and Jayah Creek Metabasalt form Cover sequence 2. Cover sequence 3 consists of the Carters Bore Rhyolite and Mt Isa Group. The Carters Bore Rhyolite is found in the south of the tenement area where it is inferred to be faulted against the Mount Guide Quartzite to the east and overlain disconformably by possible Mt Isa Group stratigraphy to the west. The Mount Isa Group stratigraphy is found in narrow partly fault bounded blocks to the east of the Mount Annable and Wonomo Faults extending south from Mt Isa. Thicker stratigraphic piles are found in the Wavely basin and the Carbine Creek Basin to the south. The Mt Isa formation in this area consists of the Warrina Park Quartzite, Moondarra Siltstone, Breakaway Shale and possibly Native Bee Siltstone in the thicker packages. Unfortunately the Urquhart shale host to the Ag-Pb-Zn and Cu ore bodies at Mt Isa has not been discovered to date. 4.2 	Mineralisation Several copper prospects and indications of copper mineralisation are known in the area. Sporadic mining activity has been carried out at Mt Annable and Blue Hills workings which lie in the Wavely Basin, and at the Bald Hills mine west of the Wavely Basin. Copper mineralisation in the Wavely basin is hosted within the Moondarra Siltstone of the Mt Isa Formation; a unit consisting of laminated shales and siltstones, often carbonaceous and graphitic, dolomitic silty sandstone, in places stromatolitic, and quartzites with interbedded argillite and sandstone. Regionally this unit is preferentially weathered and outcrops poorly and is often covered in quartzite scree from the overlying Warrina Park Quartzite. Minor occurrences of copper mineralisation are also reported from the Warrina Park Quartzite usually in the form of turquoise. Although the tenement area has been subject to a number of exploration campaigns in the past, drill testing of copper prospects and anomalies has been sporadic and limited in extent.

The Mt Isa Formation and Eastern Creek Volcanics adjacent to the Wonomo and Annable Faults is the main focus for exploration but the possibility for other locations for mineralisation will not be ignored. It is accepted that while the previous exploration activity succeeded in locating much of the outcropping mineralisation the full potential was far from realised because of the poorer exposure of the host units and the very limited follow-up drilling of detected anomalies. The Moondara Siltstone is a complicated laminated carbonaceous/graphitic siltstone containing zones of dolomitic silty sandstone, sandstone, interbedded argillite, quartzite and stromatolites. The Moondara Siltstone is very graphitic (black) at depth, but at surface leaches to a soft light chalky coloured siltstone. The Eastern Creek Volcanics consists of massive to strongly cleaved basalt lava flows interlayered with sandstones, conglomerates and other sedimentary rocks. Individual basalt flows do not generally exceed 40m in thickness. In some areas siltstones are found in the Eastern Creek Volcanics which are graphic. The Moondarra Siltstone and some sediments in the Eastern creek Volcanics are the only regional conductors in the area. All other sedimentary units in the area have little or no electromagnetic response. The region exhibits a good magnetic contrast between the Eastern Creek Volcanics and other relatively non magnetic stratigraphic units (Figure 3). Mineralisation, however, may have a magnetic response and could also have a gravity response in this area. It is expected that copper mineralisation or sulphides in the Moondara Siltstone and eastern Creek Volcanics would have a higher conductive response than the host, and any mineralisation outside the Moondara Siltstone and Eastern Creek Volcanics would be a clearly defined conductor in a resistive host. 5. 	WORK COMPLETED BY BHP MINERALS In summary the work undertaken by BHP since the inception of the joint venture has consisted of: - 	an airborne EM survey utilising the GEOTEM system - processing and interpretation of GEOTEM data ground inspection of 20 GEOTEM anomalies - moving loop EM surveying of 7 GEOTEM anomalies soil sampling on 3 EM grids 
\b16. 	GEOTEM SURVEY\b0From 23 August to 15 September 1995 Geoterrex Pty Ltd completed an airborne electromagnetic (GEOTEM) survey and magnetic survey over the Dajarra Joint Venture area to define and evaluate the potential of any conductors within the Moondarra Siltstone or Eastern Creek Volcanics or adjacent to the Mount Annable or Wonomo Faults. EPMs 7650, 7649 & 10128 	4 	September 1996 gridded data to highlight the strongest GEOTEM responses. The base for all operations was Mt Isa, Queensland The survey was conducted by collecting data along east west lines with a separation of 300m. In total, 4858 line kilometres of GEOTEM electromagnetic and magnetic data was collected during this period. A plan of the survey boundary and location is shown in Figure 1. A base frequency of 25Hz was used for the GEOTEM survey with a 4 ms pulse. Both X and Z component data were collected. The nominal terrain clearance for the plane was 105m and for the towed "bird" receiver 70m. The magnetic data was collected using a stinger magnetometer attached to be plane. Equipment and survey specifications are detailed in Appendix 2. 6.1 	GEOTEM Interpretation and Results All the GEOTEM lines were initially processed using TEMPER software to produce conductance and conductivity pseudo depth sections which were then displayed with line data and magnetic profiles. These combined sections defined many excellent conductors. The Dajarra area is known for units of conductive stratigraphy such as the Prd. Most of the GEOTEM responses in the Dajarra survey are associated with the conductive Moondara Siltstone. To better differentiate between the conductive stratigraphy and stronger conductors within it, images of gridded Z & X channel Amplitude data were produced (Figures 3 and 4). The images show areas with the strongest GEOTEM responses in the Moondara Siltstone. These images with the addition of vector geological information, were used to highlight interesting anomalies. Profiles over the anomalies were again examined SO decay curve time constants could be calculated. The most interesting anomalies are listed below in Table 1. In conjunction with GEOTEM, magnetics were collected using a stinger magnetometer. An image of the magnetics can be seen in Figure 5. 6.2 	Ground Inspection of GEOTEM Anomalies Ground inspection of the anomalies listed in Table 1 highlighted a number requiring further investigation Of the 18 anomalies examined in the field, seven were chosen to be covered with ground EM. The criteria for further work on each anomaly included the GEOTEM response and shape, stratigraphic position, structural position and other previous work, predominantly geochemistry. Anomalies 005, 009/010, 011/012 and 21/31 were all considered to have potential for further work. Temper profile sections showing the GEOTEM response for the 7 anomalies are shown in Figures 9 to 12. 
\b17. 	GROUND EM FOLLOW-UP\b0Solo Geophysics collected SIROTEM ground EM data over anomaly DJ-005 from 23 to 21 October 1995. The surveys consisted of two 2 km lines of moving loop data and eight fixed loop surveys for 15.4km of data. From 6 to 22 November 1995 Geoterrex Pty Ltd collected additional ground electromagnetic EM data using a PROTEM system in the Wavely and North Carbine basins in the Dajarra area. Anomalies DJ-009. DJ-010, DJ-011, DJ-012, DJ-021 and DJ-031 were investigated. A total of 16.2 km of moving loop PROTEM was collected Table 1 - Stage 1 Anomalies from the Dajarra GEOTEM survey Anomaly 	East 	North 	Line 	to Line 	Tau 	Z Tau 	XC 	ZC 	Mag 	Rank 	Depth 	Note 	Setting/Unit Stage 	Follow up DJ 001 	332657 	7660804 	4371 	4381 	1.47 	1.27 	15 	10 	no 	3 	surface 	may dip slightly to the east, maybe stratigraphy 	Qtz Arkose/Red Rock 	2 	Profiles/Setting alt DJ 002 	335284 	7658714 	4281 	4311 	1.71 	1.87 	15 	8 	low 	3 	surface 	flat body in Z, dips to east in X DJ 004 	336562 	7649704 	4011 	4031 	1.6 	2.69 	10 	8 	low 	3 	0-200 	X dips to east, Z interesting 400m solution horse shoe anomaly DJ 005 	334222 	7646205 	3911 	3901 	1.88 	2.25 	20 	20 	low 	2 	50-150 	X solution horse shoe anomaly, Z M shaped in Ch18 indicates 	Pim/Piw/ECVs 	1 Ground EM Follow-up vertical 	completed DJ 006 	330079 	7682009 	3421 	3451 	2.43 	2.94 	20 	25 	low 	4 	25-50 	folded conductor both limbs have same tau DJ 007 	326400 	7626500 	3 Check Profiles/Setting DJ 008 	328958 	7627207 	3261 	3271 	2.11 	2.32 	20 	slight 	3 	150-200 	X, two conductors have same tau that make up anomaly Z, picking 	on track 	3 Check Profiles/Setting up X, is close to surface, Z shows may dip to east 	2 	low 	7 	8 	2.25 	2.95 	3261 	7627198 	DJ 009 	330285 	0-100 	1 Ground EM Followup Related to DJ 9 dips to west 	0-200 	2 	1.58 	3261 	DJ 010 	331341 	7627206 	3.15 	15 	7 	low 	1 Ground EM Followup DJ 011 	328820 	7625408 	3201 	2.25 	2.53 	30 	15 	no 	2 	100 	Vertical or sips slightly to the west 	1 Ground EM Followup DJ 012 	330079 	7624181 	3163 	3182 	2.51 	3.82 	25 	40 	high 	1 	180-200 	Good coincident mag and cond anomaly south of current grid, Pib 1 	Ground EM Followup DJ 014 	331944 	7624979 	3182 	3.13 	2.85 	30 	25 	slight 	2 	200 	Individual Anomaly but sits in Pib, X may dip slightly to E, DJ 015 	330995 	7619080 	2991 	2981 	2.55 	2.94 	30 	20 	slight 	3 	350 	deeper anomaly may sit on eastern dipping arm of fold?

Four contractors and two vehicles were used to collect the data during each survey. Production was slowed due to the extreme temperatures +40 deg C, high humidity +80% and thick vegetation The topography in the area around the quartzites is dominated by steep ranges which also slowed progress on some grid lines. Grids were positioned using GPS and pegged every 100m with lines spaced 200m apart. Figure 6 shows the positions of the grids The PROTEM data was collected using 200 by 200m loops. PROTEM readings were made at both the centre of each loop and 50m from the centre of the loop, before loops were moved (Figure 7). Both 6.25 and 25 Hz PROTEM data were collected giving both good shallow and deep ground penetration. The moving loop SIROTEM data was collected using the same survey specifications as for the PROTEM. Gain 1 and 10 data was collected to enable both shallow and deep ground penetration in a similar way to the PROTEM. The fixed loop SIROTEM survey required a static 600m X 300m loop with lines of data collected of the long side of the loop (Figure 8). 7.1 	Ground EM Processing and Results The PROTEM and SIROTEM data was delivered to BHP, as AMIRA format .tem files. All lines were first plotted using AVGBHP2 and PLOTBHP5. A representative linear profile for each line is displayed in set of EM figures. It is clear that at most sites the GEOTEM anomalies have been successfully targeted with either the SIROTEM or PROTEM systems. Each line of moving loop data was processed using Imgcond to produce conductance and conductivity pseudo depth sections. The Imgcond sections clearly define all GEOTEM targets. 330000E 	340000E 	350000E 7660000N 	7660000N EPM 10873 7650000N 	ANNABLE 	7650000N ANOMALY DJEM 005 7640000N 	7640000N EPM 7650 DAJARRA JV 7630000N 	ANOMALIES 	7630000N DJEM 009 & DJEM 010 ANOMALIES DJEM 011 & DJEM 012 7620000N 	7620000N O o 	7610000N 	7610000N EPM 10128 DAJARRA JV o 7600000N 	7600000N 2 7590000N 	EPM 7649 DAJARRA JV 	7590000N ANOMALIES DJEM021 & DJEM 031 7580000N 	7580000N 7570000N 	7570000N 330000E 	340000E 	350000E Grid Line er oston S wire Grid L ine 1aom 5Om Grid Line 20m A 84 b contro 	Ersbane Drawing 	No- 	MAeS Nol FGURE 1 Prepares 	jonnstone 	WBMP 	owwoLoone orewn 	RAM : Date e uniges wn RENNsed Re Moblle reciever positions K EMP Mlvecate PV.

The anomaly looks to be dipping to the west in the conductivity and conductance pseudo-sections, But the distemper 5 solution seems to indicate that the anomaly may be dipping to the east. The anomaly has a conductance around 20 (S) with a depth of less than 50m at its shallowest point. Tau calculations show the best decay as 2.29 for X component data (Figures 9a and 9b) The anomaly has good geophysical characteristics and sits in an interesting geological position. The amplitude images over this anomaly indicate that the conductor is offset by some structure into two parts. Two lines of ground EM PROTEM were collected over each part of the anomaly to help refine its electromagnetic response. Figure 9e shows Z-amplitude moving loop profile data from line 9500N, and Figure 9d shows the same data for line 8900N. Conductance and conductivity sections (Figures 9f and 9i) from these two lines shows a conductor dipping away to the west. As seen in the profile data the conductor seems to be a classic M shaped anomaly. However at first we were not sure whether two separate conductors were detected by each moving loop line SO fixed loop SIROTEM was collected over each potential conductor defined in the Moving Loop lines. Thus eight loops of data was collected over the 4 potential conductors. The results from the fixed Loop SIROTEM clearly showed only one conductor was present on each line with an offset between the moving loop lines. Modelling of both data sets shows the conductor has a depth of 150m and a dip of 15 degrees to the east. Outcropping geology with a similar dip to the conductor and poor geochemistry, in addition to a shallow modelled depth and marginal time decay has downgraded the potential of this anomaly. The geophysical response is most likely due to un-weathered Moondarra siltstone at depth adjacent to the Mount Annable fault. 333000E 	334000E 	335000E 	336000E EPM 10873 ANNABLE 7648000N 	7648000N ANOMALY I 	DJEM 005 7647200N 7647000N 	7647000N 	7647000N 7646800N 7646600N 7646400N 7646200N 7646000N 	7646000N 	7646000N 7645800N 7645600N 7645000N 	7645000N 333000E 	334000E 	335000E 	336000E Scale 1 : 25,000 O 	500 	1000 	1500 	2000 metres Transverse Mercator Projection.

Its conductance is around 20 (S) with a depth between 80m and 250m. Anomaly 9 (Figures 10a & 10b) is not well defined in the conductance or conductivity pseudo-sections but has a high amplitude response in both the X and Z profile data. Decay calculations for both anomalies is around the 1.5 value which is quite low. It was decided that further work on anomalies 9 and 10 should proceed as both anomalies sit in the Wavely basin in Mt Isa formation not far from known mineralisation (Blue Hills Mine). Three lines of ground electromagnetic PROTEM was collected over anomalies 9 and 10 to help refine their electromagnetic response. Figures 10e, 10f & 10g show the Z-amplitude moving loop data for lines 9100N, 9300N and 9500N respectively. The line profiles indicate 2 high amplitude responses in the early channels which are likely to represent the responses seen in the GEOTEM. In the late channels a wide conductor is defined on the western side of the lines, towards the western end of the lines the late channels become negative which may indicate an IP response. All inversions over the western section of each line give incorrect results. Conductance and conductivity inversion sections (Figures 10h and 10m) from these lines show a deep synformal conductor shallowing towards the centre of each line. This conductor seems quite deep, its shallowest point is on line 9300N at station 11300E with a depth of 300m. More analysis of these results is required before any further work on these anomalies is planned. 328000E 	329000E 	330000E 	331000E 	332000E 7628000N 	7628000N 7627600N 7627400N ANOMALIES 	7627200N DJEM 009 & 7627000N 	7627000N 	7627000N DJEM 010 7626800N 7626600N 7626400N 7626000N 	7626000N 7625600N 7625400N N 7625200N A 7625000N 	7625000N 	7625000N 7624800N Scale 1 : 25,000 ANOMALIES 	7624600N 0 	500 	1000 m DJEM 011 & 7624400N DJEM 012 	Transverse Mercator Projection.

The western anomaly DJ-011 is wider than anomaly DJ-012 to the east. The GEOTEM line 3163 (figures 11c & 11d), which is further south, shows only anomaly DJ-012. The conductance of anomaly DJ-011 is around 20 (S) with a depth between 50m and 80m. Tau calculations give a better result in the Z component suggestion better coupling on this axis. Anomaly DJ-011 is quite discrete, sitting adjacent to the Wonomo fault. DJ-012 has a conductance of 25 (S) and a good decay in the Z component. Although this anomaly has a long strike length and could be conductive stratigraphy its Z component decay constant (Tau) is excellent. Four lines of ground EM PROTEM were collected over these anomalies to help refine their electromagnetic response. Figure 9e shows a plan image of the lines and grided channel 11 response, Z-amplitude moving loop profiles for lines 9100N, 9500N, 9300N and 9700N are shown in figures 11g to 11j respectively The earlier time/channels from profiles clearly define the two GEOTEM anomalies these responses can also bee seen in the conductance and conductivity sections (Figures 11k and 1lr) calculated from the line data. The geology in this area is quite steep. This can be seen in some of the M shaped anomalies in the late times of the profile data. Unfortunately inversions do not adequately model such responses. Anomaly DJ-011 seems to be wide and shallow in the profiles and the inversions confirm this. Anomaly DJ-012 seems to become M shaped in the late channels on line 9500N indicating a steeper dip. Inversions suggest that the conductor is shallow with a complex structure. An additional steeply dipping anomaly has been discovered to the east of DJ-011. This anomaly can be seen as M shaped responses in the profile data from lines 9300N and 9500N at eastings 11300E and 11250E respectively. This anomaly does not seem to be present in the additional lines to the north and south. I think this new anomaly is an interesting target which may require further investigation. Additional plate modelling and a review of geochemistry is required before any drilling is planned 328000E 	329000E 	330000E 	331000E 	332000E 7628000N 	7628000N 7627600N 7627400N ANOMALIES 	7627200N DJEM 009 & 7627000N 	7627000N 	7627000N DJEM 010 7626800N 7626600N 7626400N 7626000N 	7626000N 7625600N 7625400N N 7625200N A 7625000N 	7625000N 	7625000N 7624800N 7624600N 	ANOMALIES 	Scale 1 : 25,000 0 	500 	1000 m DJEM 011 & 7624400N DJEM 012 	Transverse Mercator Projection.

Anomaly DJ-031 (Figures 12c & 12d) is not as well defined in the conductance or conductivity pseudo-sections but has a high amplitude response in both the X and Z profile data. Decay calculations for anomaly DJ-031 are around 1.7 which is quite low. While the decay constant for anomaly DJ-021 is better at approximately 2.7 It was decided that a grid over DJ-021 should be extended to cover DJ-031 which represents a different style of GEOTEM response. Two lines of ground electromagnetic PROTEM was collected over anomalies DJ-021 and DJ-031 to help refine their electromagnetic response. Figures 12e shows a plan of the two PROTEM lines. Figures 11g & 12h show the Z-amplitude moving loop data for lines 9700N and 9900N respectively. In the early channels the line profiles show two responses similar to those seen in the GEOTEM, but in the late channels the response over anomaly DJ-021 becomes M shaped and wide. In the late channels the response over anomaly DJ-031 becomes negative indicating an IP effect. Because of this IP effect the inversions on data over anomaly DJ-031 are incorrect. The inversions for the each profile over DJ-021 (Figures 121 to 121) indicate a surface conductor and a deeper conductor probably dipping to the west. DJ-021 may be a stratigraphic response, geochemistry and geology are needed to confirm this. The IP effect from DJ-031 is interesting and represents a good target, the wavelength of the response on line profiles indicate the anomaly is fairly shallow. Geochemistry will be needed to confirm anomaly as a target. An additional response in the moving loop data with a lower amplitude early channel response and a good late channel decay is seen at 11200E on both lines. This anomaly represents an excellent target, with a depth around 200m, once again geochemistry is required to screen this target. 344000E 	345000E 	346000E EPM 7649 DAJARRA JV 7587000N 	7587000N ANOMALIES DJEM 021 & DJEM 031 7586000N 	7586000N 7585900N 7585700N 7585500N 7585300N 7585100N 7585000N 	7585000N 7584900N 7584700N 7584000N 	7584000N 344000E 	345000E 	346000E Scale 1 : 25.000 0 	500 	1000 	1500 	2000 metres Transverse Mercator Projection.
