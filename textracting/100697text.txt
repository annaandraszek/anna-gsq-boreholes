2 DRILLING/ENGINEERING DATA
2.1 DRILLING SUMMARY
Kaniva 2 is an exploration core hole located 32.80 Km West of Cecil Plains in Queensland's Surat Basin. It
was
drilled
in
phases
for
Arrow
Energy
Pty
Ltd
by
contracting
Nitro
Drilling
(Nitro
14)
in
Authority
to
Prospect 746 (ATP 746). The well was drilled to assess Walloon Coal Measures (WCM) and establish the
well head location in the Kaniva area.
Nitro 14 spudded the surface section at 14:30 hours on 2nd November 2014. Bit 1 an outside diameter (OD)
1/2" (216 mm) PDC was used to mud drill from 1.50m MD GL to 73.72m MD GL. A string of OD 7" (178
mm) steel casing was installed from 1.49m MD GL to 73.22m MD GL and cemented on the 3rd November
2014 by the Halliburton. The casing string was fitted with a float shoe at the end of the string with check
valve to guide and prevent cement slurry flow back.
After an initial blow out preventer (BOP) test failure due to surface leaks, a successful BOP test was
conducted on 4th November 2014 to a low pressure of 250.00psi and a high pressure of 1500 psi to
validate the previous casing integrity.
Nitro 14 commenced drilling the intermediate section at 18:30 hours on 4th November 2014. Bit 2, an OD 6
18" (156 mm) polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit tagged cement used for setting the surface casing
at 57.45m MD GL and mud drilled out into fresh formation A Formation Integrity Test (FIT) was
conducted at 77.22m MD GL with a surface pressure of 96.80ps and a mud weight of 8.40ppg
and
established an equivalent mud weight (EMW) of 15.67ppg. Bit 2 continued drilling to an intermediate
section total depth of 466.15m MD GL. A string of OD 4 1/2" (114 mm) stee casing were installed from
1.17m MD GL to 462.33m MD GL and cemented on 8th November 2014 by Halliburton. The casing string
was fitted with a float shoe at the end of the string with check valve to guide and prevent cement slurry flow
back.
After cementing the OD 4 1/2" (114 mm) steel casing, the BOP was removed from the wellhead and the
OD 4 1/2" (114 mm) casing was cut to a desirable length The BOP was installed again and successfully
tested on th and 10th November 2014 to validate the previous casing integrity.
Nitro 14 commenced the production section at 12:00 hours on 10tr November 2014. Bit 3 an OD 3 78"
(96 mm) HQ3 bit, tagged cement utilised for setting the intermediate casing at 450.35m MD GL
and mud cored out into fresh formation. A Formation Integrity Test (FIT) was conducted at 469.15m
MD GL with a mud weight of 8.70ppg and established an equivalent mud weight (EMW) of 15.40ppg. Bit
3 continued coring to 486.35m MD GL. The well was circulated clean and bit 3 was removed and
replaced with bit 4. Bit 4 an OD 78" (96 mm) HQ3 bit, was run in hole and continued coring to a TD
of 750.85m MD GL which was reached at 19:45 hours on 16thNovember 2014.
On 16th November 2014, the HQ drilling rods parted down hole due to tight hole conditions. The attached
HQ drill rods were removed from the well. A total of 624.00 metres of core pipe was removed from the
well. A temporary kill string was tripped into the hole to 462.33m MD GL while Nitro 14 waited for pipe
fishing equipment to arrive at site.
After the fishing equipment arrived on site, several unsuccessful attempts were conducted to retrieve the
parted rods or fish from the well using Bowen spear with Mayhew Junior, and 2" DZ50 drill pipes fishing
string from 17th November 2014 to 25th November 2014.
A 2" DZ50 string was dislodged in the well on 24th November 2014 during the fishing operation. This
second fish was partially retrieved from the wel to surface on 25th November 2014.
5/24

KANIVA 2 WELL COMPLETION AND ABANDONMENT REPORT
A lead impression block (LIB) was sourced to determine the exact position of the top of the second 2" DZ50
fish in the well at 152.20 m MD GL on 28th November 2014. LIB is a tool used to make an accurate
impression of a fish or obstruction down hole to determine the tool's position and condition.
A decision was made after tagging the top of last fish with LIB to leave the whole fish down the well after
several unsuccessful attempts to retrieve the fish. Due to obstructions left in the hole, no wireline logging
operations were conducted A string of 2 3/8" (60 mm) EUE tubing was run into the well before it was
suspended.
During the drilling operations, twenty one canisters giving a total thickness of 12.25m, as well as proximate
and geotechnical samples were collected in the field by ALS Oil & Gas Pty Ltd (ALS). Coal seam gas
desorption was conducted in the field and further analysis of gas composition in the ALS laboratory.
The well was suspended and Nitro 14 was rig released from site at 08:30 hours on 29th November 2014.
The well head location was surveyed by David Peter Nevell on 3rd June 2016 after the rig release.
Sirius Well Manufacturing Services (SWMS 6) began mobilising to Kaniva 2 on 3rd December 2016. A blow
out preventer (BOP) test was successfully conducted on December 2016 to a low pressure
of 200 psi for 5 minutes and a high pressure of 750psi for 10 minutes. The 2 38" (60 mm) EUE tubing
was removed from the well. Vause wireline mobilised to Kaniva 2 on 4th December 2016 and set a
permanent bridge plug at 149.00m MD GL on the same day.
The bridge plug was pressure tested before cementing the well to surface. A successful pressure test
was conducted to a low of 250psi for 5 minutes and a high pressure of 750psi for 10 minutes.
Kaniva 2 was cemented in a single stage from 1.50m MD GL to 147.50m MD GL on 4th December 2016 by
Halliburton. SWMS 6 was rig released from Kaniva 2 at 09:00 hours on 5th December 2016.
Veolia completed the abandonment of Kaniva 2 by cutting and capping the casing below ground level on
10th December 2016. Kaniva 2 is plugged and abandoned in accordance with the Petroleum and Gas
(Safety and Production) Regulation 2004.
All depths in this report are measured depth from ground level. Drillers' daily drilling reports (DDR) used the rotary
Kelly bushing (RKB) as the datum which was 0.85m for Nitro 14 and 1.28m for SWMS 6.
During compilation of the well completion report some data inaccuracies were noted in the primary well site
documents; where present the correct value has been marked in the appendix and correct value used throughout
the report.

KANIVA 2 WELL COMPLETION AND ABANDONMENT REPORT
2.9 ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND HAZARDS
Additiona equipment was abandoned in the well after unsuccessful attempts to retrieve parted drilling
rods or fish from down the hole. The first fish was lost in the well during cleaning of the well on 16th
November 2014, and consisted of HQ3 drilling rods with inner core barrel situated from 623.65m MD GL
to 750.85m MD GL.
The second fish was lost inside the first one on 24th November 2014 during a failed attempt to retrieve
the HQ3 drilling rods using 2" DZ50 drilling pipes. The 2" DZ50 drilling string was situated from 152.20m

Net coals were not calculated using an open hole density cut off of 1.85 g/cc due to absence of wireline logs.
Note lithostratigraphic units in the table above were derived from nearby well logs in the model, but no
net coal could be assigned to this stratigraphy.

COAL GEOLOGY OF THE SURAT BASIN
4.6.1 Surat Basin
The Surat Basin is a large intracratonic basin of Mesozoic age covering approximately 300,000km2 in
south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales (Figure 2). The basin forms part of the larger
Great Australian Basin (Green et al., 1997) and interfingers westward across the Nebine Ridge with the
Eromanga Basin and eastward across the Kumbarilla Ridge with the Clarence-Moreton Basin (Exon,
1976). Basin blocks consisting of the Central West Fold Belt and the New England Fold Belt limit the
basin to the south while in the north the basin unconformably overlies Triassic and Permian sediments
of the Bowen Basin.
The Surat Basin contains up to 2,500m of sedimentary rocks deposited during the later Triassic to Early
Cretaceous periods (Surat Basin Stratigraphic Section). The succession in the basin consists of five
fining-upwards sedimentary cycles dominated by fluvio-lacustrine deposits (Exon, 1976; Exon and
Burger, 1981; Day et al., 1983). The lower part of each cycle typically comprises coarse-grained mature
sandstone, grading to more labile sandstone and siltstone with mostly siltstone, mudstone and coal in
the upper part. In the Cretaceous, inundation of the land through an increase in sea leve led to
deposition of predominantly coastal plain and shallow sediments in two cycles.
Structurally, the Surat Basin is relatively simple, with the area of maximum deposition in the Mimosa
Syncline which overlies the thickest Permian-Triassic rocks in the Taroom Trough of the underlying
Bowen Basin (Day et al., 1983) Major faulting within the basin typically mirrors basinal boundary faults
of the underlying Bowen Basin. Substantial folding is evident across the basin, which is due to
compaction and draping, as well as some rejuvenation of older pre-Jurassic structures and faults.
Formations outcrop along the northern erosional boundary and dip gently to the south and southwest at
less than 5o.
A simplified stratigraphic section of the Surat Basin is shown in Figure 3. Basin fill commenced with the
Precipice Sandstone, which was overlain by the siltier Evergreen Formation. A renewal of sedimentation
laid down the Hutton Sandstone. Above these the Walloon Coal Measures (WCM) were conformably
deposited. Unconformably overlying the WCM is the Springbok Sandstone (or Kumbarilla Beds further
east). The springbok sandstone is overlain by the Westbourne Formation and Gubberamunda
Sandstone. In most areas, the Surat Basin sequence is overlain by tertiary sediments and alluvial
deposits.

4.6.2 Eastern Surat Walloon Coal Measures
The Middle Jurassic WCM form part of the Injune Creek Group (after McKellar 1999) and are well
developed throughout the Surat Basin. The coal measures range in thickness from less than 50m to
greater than 700m and comprise very fine to medium grained, labile, argillaceous sandstone, siltstone,
mudstone and coals These lithologies generally present themselves in the form of a series of fining up
sequences usually capped by a coa seam.
The WCM are divided into two main intervals the Juandah Coal Measures (JCM) and Taroom Coal
Measures (TCM) The JCM and TCM are further divided into lithostratigraphic members or coal seam
packages; in descending stratigraphic order these are the Kogan, Macalister, Wambo, Argyle, Upper
Taroom and Condamine Members.
Each coal group is identified on the basis of grouping together cycles or coa seams. For example the
Wambo group consists of a number of sub-cycles and seams packaged together to form the one coal
group. The character of each coal group can vary greatly between fields and areas and it is often very
difficult to correlate coal seams even over a short distance. Often the most regionally pervasive and
reliable correlation markers are the seams of the Macalister group of the JCM and the Condamine group
of the TCM.
As can be seen in Figure 3, the top of the WCM is marked by an erosional unconformity (base
Springbok). This erosional base in some areas can act to remove most or all of the JCM. The contact
between the Springbok and WCM can be identified during drilling by a change in lithology from clean
light grey quartz sandstone to interbedded silts, clays, coals, and dark grey clay choked sandstones. A
decrease in drilling rate, an increase in mud pressure due to clays on the bit, and an increase in
background gas may also be observed.
The Eurombah Formation forms the base of the coa prone section of the WCM. The Eurombah
Formation can be identified by massive fine to medium grained lithic/feldspathic sandstones. These
sandstones are generally tight and very slow to drill.
The Hutton Sandstone marks the base of the Eurombah Formation. This unit can be identified as a fine to
medium grained, light grey clean sandstone. The Hutton Sandstone is usually identified on wireline logs
by a sharp Spontaneous Potential (SP) break, and a lesser gamma break.
