This package/folder contains code all about segmenting a report file into its sections (according to the table of contents).

You don't need to run anything in folder unless specifically looking into these processes. If so, look at search_report.py as the main file.

If you want to edit a model, you'll have to delete or rename the model file you're modifying, and the model will be trained and saved next time you a function that needs it to exist.
Models used are at models/production/
Datasets are similarly found at datasets/production

Models/datasets inside folders containing "borehole" are for table classification in borehole/tables.py
