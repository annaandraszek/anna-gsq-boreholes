The borehole package is centred on getting borehole information out of tables. The tables.py file contains many operations that act on tables, all of which were initally written to support table classification (as containing borehole references or not, to make the later search for the references shorter). \n",

    "## Table classification model\n",
    "\n",
    "Table classification is based on a labelled dataset of table content stored as text and a sckit-learn pipeline comprising of TfidfVectorizer and Complement Naive Bayes for binary classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is programatically generated from tables files, then samples can be labelled in the csv or one-by-one in a python notebook. The classes are 0 (for: doesn't contain any reference to borehole names) and 1 (for the opposite). Labelling can be difficult for some tables; labelling inside the notebook can be more accurate as the context of the table structure is shown (but this process is also much slower as labelling is done one at a time). Another reason apart from structure that labelling can be a challenge is when it's not fully clear if the table contains borehole references. The rule of thumb I used, was that if it's not clear to me, it woudln't be clear to the classifier, so that should be labelled as a 0. By \"clear\" I mean: does not only the name/reference (which will be unique to the borehole and therefore not common enough to be a vocabulary term in the vectoriser) appear, but do key terms that indicate the presence of boreholes?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a table which, say, uses a borehole name such that that knowledge that it is a borehole is implicit, perhaps taken from knowing the pattern of borehole names and being able to make an educated guess, but no indicator terms that label it as such exist in the table as well, should be classed as a 0, wheras explicit references will be 1s. Take a look at the dataset in report/datasets/boreholes/table_content.csv for examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the dataset is already created, running tables.create_dataset() can be skipped. If you don't have a dataset, run this function without parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got a dataset with some labels, run tables.train(0) to train the model on it. The '0' represents that you don't want to label any more samples manually before doing this - you must have this if you have unlabelled samples in your dataset, or the function will deafult to giving you 10 samples to label first (in the principle of using active learning to incrementally improve your model by labelling data which will most help it improve)."
